- 👋 Hi, I’m @OneEsk19, not my real name, obvs!
- 👀 I’m trained in Biology and Bioinformatics but am interested in everything to do with data and the technology used to manipulate it.
- 🌱 My favourite programming language is R and while I dislike Python I can use it at a basic level if I have to. I also like using Bash.
- ✨ Hardware: Dual boot (Win10 + Ubuntu 20.04) desktop PC. Raspberry Pi home network file server (headless). Next project: Raspberry pi media player (Netflix, YT etc) for kid's room.
- 💞️ Happy to collaborate if you think I may be useful!
